			<font size="2">
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://160.40.50.183/cloud4all/SatManual.pdf">Get semantic alignment tool manual.</a>
			</font>
			<br />
			<br />
			<p>
				<font size="2"> This version has been integrated with the
					latest ontological semantic framework v1.7 that can be accessed by
					the following url: <a target="_blank" href="http://160.40.50.183/cloud4all">http://160.40.50.183/cloud4all</a>
				</font>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<font size="2"> The Tool can be used by Vendors/service
					providers, etc. that they would like to include their applications
					and their customizable settings in the Cloud4all/GPII architecture,
					as well as by Developers /designers and interested users to have
					access on the customizable settings of the supported applications.
				</font>
			</p>

			<p>
				<font size="2"> More specifically, the tool can support users
					for performing syntactic and semantic analysis of their solutions'
					settings as well as a semi-automatic categorization of
					solutions/settings that are stored in the semantic Framework of
					content and solutions ontology. Thus, the tool can assist
					users/vendors/service providers to help visualising annotated
					content presented in the ontology as well as for improving existing
					annotation structures and instances (e.g. a service provider has
					the intention to semantically align its service in order to be
					provided through the Cloud infrastructure). </font>
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<font size="2"> The Semantic alignment Tool can provide to the
					users some of the following functionalities:
					<ul>
						<li>Giving access to the ontological data of the Cloud4all
							semantic framework (stored data for ICT solutions and their
							settings)</li>
						<li>Searching (by a free text and /or by categorization
							lists) for solutions, settings, etc, that are stored in the
							solutions ontology</li>
						<li>Adding a new solution/setting to the solutions ontology
							(without previous experience in cloud4all terms)</li>
						<li>Proposing a new term in the common terms registry</li>
					</ul>
